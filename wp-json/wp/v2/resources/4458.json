Most personal loans are either secured or unsecured. A secured personal loan requires that borrowers offer collateral, or something of value, to the lender\u2013such as the rights to their home or car, to protect the lender in case the loan amount can\u2019t be paid off. Secured loans include mortgages, auto loans, home equity lines of credit, business loans, and land loans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsecured loans do not require collateral. However, because lenders are not protected by collateral like they are with secured loans, they often charge higher interest rates or require high credit scores for unsecured loans because the loan is a greater risk for them. To learn more about different types of personal loans, read our <a href=\"<?php echo $row['url']; ?>resources/education-on-personal-loans/different-types-of-personal-loans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blog post</a> on the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What determines the cost of a personal loan?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re looking to figure out what a personal loan will cost you, the payment calculator above is a good place to start. That\u2019s because you likely already have the necessary information to figure out the cost of a personal loan:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The total amount of money you\u2019re borrowing</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The interest rate</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The length of the loan</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With this information, you can use the calculator to see how much interest you will pay over the course of the loan. To find a more exact cost of your personal loan, be sure to ask the lender about any fees they may charge so you can add that to the total cost of the personal loan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about how to qualify and apply for a personal loan by reading our blog <a href=\"<?php echo $row['url']; ?>resources/education-on-personal-loans/how-to-qualify-and-apply-for-a-personal-loan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does my credit score affect a personal loan?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your credit score goes a long way toward determining what kind of terms you\u2019ll get on a personal loan. Why? Because if you have a good credit score and credit history, you\u2019re likely to qualify for much lower interest rates than if your credit score is low. This is because a good credit history shows that you\u2019re a trustworthy borrower who makes payments on time and has <a href=\"<?php echo $row['url']; ?>resources/education-on-personal-loans/how-personal-loan-could-help-build-credit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">built their credit</a>. And that is less risky for a lender, which is why they can offer better interest rates. With a low credit score, a borrower isn\u2019t as easily trusted, so the lender charges high interest rates to protect themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s the difference between APR and APY?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be easy to confuse Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and Annual Percentage Yield (APY). What\u2019s the difference between the two?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong> is what you pay to take out a loan, which is the interest rate plus fees. Sometimes APR is the same as the loan\u2019s interest rate, as is the case with most credit cards. An APR can also be fixed (the rate stays the same throughout the loan term) or variable (the rate may change based on market conditions). The higher the APR, the more money you\u2019re paying for your loan.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Annual Percentage Yield (APY) </strong>is the actual rate of return that will be earned in one year if the interest is compounded. These rates are what you\u2019d look for when opening a checking account, savings account, or certificate of deposit (CD). The higher the APY on your account, the more interest you will likely collect.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>APY is similar to the APR used for loans. The APR shows the percentage that the borrower will pay over a year in interest and fees for the loan. However, only APY takes into account compound interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find more information on personal loans</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The more you know about personal loans, the better financial decisions you can make for your situation.
